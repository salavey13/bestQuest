    text = "Many Russians have likely noticed a recent flood of political memes. One example is the abundance of posts related to Wagner's canceled trip to Moscow. Interestingly, people have been sharing funny pictures rather than expressing fear or anger. In the days that followed, they continued to repost and make fun of the situation instead of showing support for their president. Posting memes has become the last resort for many Russians who want to express their disapproval of the current authorities and their policies, but don't have other options for venting. We are no longer allowed to hold protests or demand change. Making fun of events through memes has become a legitimate phenomenon in our lives. Today, we will discuss the history of one specific meme: the snuff box meme. This meme can be seen in pictures or referenced in a specific context. Phrases like \"I hope the snuff box is on its way\" are often posted after another questionable action by Russian authorities. The snuff box alludes to Emperor Paul I of Russia, who was assassinated and is said to haunt St. Michael's Castle. Today, we will explore the events that led to the snuff box becoming an iconic symbol and eventually a meme, two centuries later. When it comes to Russian emperors, power has always been robust, stable, absolute, and undivided. Our current ruler is often referred to as a czar, emphasizing his unchallengeable authority. However, many people are unaware of the series of palace coups that led to the transfer of power throughout history. This tradition began with Peter the Great, who believed that succession should not follow a set rule but should depend on the monarch's choice. He thought this would strengthen the monarch's power by allowing them to select an heir who would continue their political line. Many rulers believe that if they can replace an institution with their own judgment, they should. This warped perspective leads them to believe that challenges, rules, and restrictions are unnecessary and can be replaced by their own wisdom and authority. They think it adds a more royal aura. For example, they may lift term limits, extend their own term, or choose their own heir. However, this approach has not always worked out well. In 1722, Peter the Great signed the Succession to the Crown Act, which allowed the czar to choose their own heir. However, after his death in 1725, chaos ensued. Some czars left wills, while others did not. Some wills were lost or destroyed. The Succession Act allowed for multiple potential heirs, leading to imprisonment, exile, and even death for some. People with little royal lineage were ascending the throne, and their legitimacy was often questioned. This lack of legitimacy made it difficult for the monarch to maintain power and prevent mutinies. To solve this problem, they resorted to various means, including libel and murder. Empress Catherine the Great, Paul's mother, came to power after her husband, Peter III, was killed in a plot. She faced the same challenge of maintaining legitimacy, as she was a German princess ruling over Russia. She even spread rumors about her son's true parentage to undermine his claim to the throne. The Succession to the Crown Act, intended to strengthen the monarch's power, actually turned the entire dynasty into a plaything of the elites. Without legitimacy, a monarch cannot have solid authority. Unless a clear and widely recognized rule is followed during the transfer of power, the monarch will always be vulnerable and unsure of the elites' support. This lack of certainty led to numerous palace coups throughout the 18th century. Emperor Paul I, the son of Catherine the Great and Peter III, came to power in 1796 after his mother's death. He was 42 years old at the time. Despite his mother overthrowing his father years earlier, many believed that Paul would be crowned as soon as he turned 18. However, the balance of power in the court of Empress Catherine favored Paul, who was supported by the liberal-leaning political spectrum. His mentor, Nikita Panin, introduced him to draft constitutions and progressive reforms. There was even a plot to help Paul ascend the throne, but it was discovered, and the conspirators were banished. Before his coronation, Paul's life was filled with turmoil. His mother controlled every aspect of his life, even taking charge of his sons' upbringing. She would send him and his wife abroad, only to call them back. Empress Catherine was always suspicious of him, and her suspicions were not unfounded. Overall, the Succession Act, intended to solidify the monarch's power, instead led to a history of palace coups and a lack of legitimacy. During his reign, Emperor Paul faced many challenges and controversies. His father was killed in a coup and his cousin, Ivan VI, was stabbed in prison. It was clear that Catherine, the empress, did not want her son to succeed her. Instead, she favored her grandson Alexander. However, when Catherine died, Paul was unexpectedly named the new emperor by Nikolai Zubov, Catherine's suitor's brother. This upset many skeptics who believed Catherine wanted Alexander to take the throne. Paul's reign started off poorly, as he seemed unfit for the role. He had a sketchy reputation and his legitimacy as the true heir was questioned. Despite this, Paul disappointed both his supporters and those who wanted Catherine's policies to continue under Alexander. He abandoned his previous beliefs in a draft constitution, limited monarchy, equity, and freedom. Paul had experienced fear and humiliation, and he believed his right to the throne had already been violated. He almost gave up hope of being crowned. Additionally, the French Revolution had scared many European monarchs, including Paul, who believed the French king had not been ruthless enough. Paul wanted to restore the monarchy and believed this would protect Russia from revolutions and coups. However, his idea of the past was romanticized and unrealistic. He did not want to bring back medieval practices, but rather an idealized version of the past that never truly existed. Paul's vision of a perfect state relied on the knighthood and complete obedience to the monarchy. He wanted the nobility to adhere to strict ethical standards and be willing to face punishment. Once he became emperor, Paul's main goals were to dismantle Catherine's legacy and strengthen his own power. He made changes to the Succession Act to ensure that only men could ascend the throne, preventing another woman from ruling. This act remained in place until the end of the Russian Empire. Despite its undemocratic nature, this institutional legitimacy helped the monarchy withstand the Decembrist Revolt in 1825. Paul repealed many of Catherine's decrees and reinstated those that she had repealed. He revoked privileges granted to the nobility, such as exemption from corporal punishment and taxation. He also closed the loophole that allowed children of nobles to join regiments at a young age and gain high ranks. Paul implemented strict censorship and surveillance measures to prevent revolution or coup attempts. The secret police infiltrated every society and club, bribed servants, and enforced postal censorship. This led to a decrease in publications and the destruction of many journals, letters, and memoirs. Paul was suspicious of assemblies and gatherings, and any perceived deviation from the norm could result in punishment or imprisonment. Meanwhile, the younger generation of nobles who grew up during Catherine's reign embraced contemporary trends and did not support Paul's desire to return to the past. Throughout his reign, Paul was suspicious of everyone and often imprisoned or exiled individuals without clear evidence of their involvement in conspiracies. This led to the dismissal of loyal officers and the repression of innocent people. In the early morning hours of March 12, 1801, Emperor Paul was assassinated. Plots and conspiracies had occurred before and continued to happen in cycles. After the New Year celebration of 1801, Paul's closest associates planned their move. Count Peter von der Pahlen, Paul's confidante, convinced the emperor that he was in control of the situation and had firsthand knowledge of the conspirators' intentions. Von der Pahlen had already discussed the coup scenario with heir apparent Alexander, who approved as long as Paul was allowed to live. Von der Pahlen also tried to convince the other conspirators that Paul would be a lifelong threat if left alive. Despite Paul's secret police, repression, and censorship, his power proved to be weak. According to contemporary memoirs, almost everyone knew about the plot, including noblemen, the poor, and even coachmen. On the night of the assassination, high-profile and trusted officials entered St. Michael's Castle without much resistance. Nikolai Zubov, who enjoyed Paul's trust, was said to have struck the emperor with a snuff box or a silk scarf. The next day, it was announced that Paul had died from a stroke, but everyone knew the truth. Two centuries later, the snuff box became a symbol of the assassination. The lesson learned is that it is better to gain or lose power through legal means such as impeachment, elections, and court hearings. Dictators should not become too confident and should rely on institutions rather than trying to seize absolute power. Otherwise, a coup may be inevitable, and no amount of alertness or loyalty will prevent it."

    text2 = "In today's video, we will be discussing a crucial topic: Russia's alleged plans to damage the Zaporizhia nuclear power plants. Both Moscow and Kiev have accused each other of plotting an attack on the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant. We will delve into the dangerous provocations and claims surrounding this potential attack. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any inaccurate statements I may have made in my previous videos. I have spent the last two days conducting research to better understand the risk of an attack on the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant. In this video, I will provide you with a crash course in nuclear power to explain why the risk may not be as great as previously thought. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in geology and served as a nuclear and missile operations officer in the United States Air Force. While I have a good understanding of the physics and chemistry involved, I am by no means an expert. I am simply a person on YouTube trying to share useful information. In the pinned comments, I will provide links to the resources I used, including a blog post by Cheryl Rofer, a playlist on nuclear power by the Illinois Energy Prof channel, and a recent Twitter space event by the Miria report featuring a panel of experts who support Ukraine. During the Miria report's podcast, the experts unanimously stated that the media has been exaggerating the potential fallout if Russia were to attack the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. Now, let me explain how the plant operates and why the risk may not be as significant as previously believed. To understand nuclear power, we need to start with uranium, which is the key material that enables nuclear power. Uranium is the 92nd element on the periodic table and is quite common. It can be found in various locations, with the largest concentrations being in Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada, the United States, and Russia. When uranium is extracted from sandstone deposits, it becomes yellow cake uranium (U3O8). Uranium has naturally occurring isotopes, with uranium-238 and uranium-235 being the most common. Both isotopes have 92 protons in their nucleus but differ in the number of neutrons (146 for uranium-238 and 143 for uranium-235). In the Earth's crust, uranium-238 makes up 99.3% of naturally occurring uranium, while uranium-235, which is the desired isotope for nuclear fuel, only makes up 0.7%. To increase the percentage of uranium-235, various methods can be used, with centrifuges being the most common today. By spinning the uranium, the heavier uranium-238 separates from the lighter uranium-235, allowing for their separation based on their position in the centrifuge. To generate nuclear power, the percentage of uranium-235 needs to be increased to 3%, while uranium-238 is reduced to 97%. On the other hand, to create a nuclear weapon, the percentage of uranium-235 must be increased to 90%, with uranium-238 reduced to 10%. Now, let's discuss the design of a light water nuclear reactor, which is different from the Chernobyl reactor. The reactor vessel holds the fuel and control rods, and pressurized water is pumped through the reactor. As the water is pressurized, its temperature can exceed 100 degrees Celsius. The water then moves into another tank where a different flow of water, which is not pressurized, comes in. Once this water surpasses 100 degrees Celsius, steam is generated. The steam is then directed through turbines, which spin and generate electricity. After passing through the turbine, the steam needs to be condensed in the cooling tower. It is important to note that the cooling tower is not where the nuclear reactor is located. Once the water is condensed, it is fed back into the system to generate more steam. The core of the reactor is situated inside the containment structure, which is typically made of three feet of steel-reinforced concrete. To generate heat in a nuclear reactor, fission needs to occur by splitting uranium-235. This is achieved by bombarding the uranium-235 atom with a neutron. The core of a nuclear reactor is where neutrons are introduced to create a controlled and small chain reaction. When uranium-235 is hit by a neutron, it splits into lighter elements, releases more neutrons, and generates energy and heat. This heat is used to boil water and produce steam. However, for a successful fission event, the neutron needs to be traveling at a slow rate. Neutrons ejected from the core of the atom during fission are typically fast, making it less likely for them to hit other uranium-235 atoms and sustain the chain reaction. To address this issue, a moderator is used in nuclear reactors. In the case of light water reactors, water serves as both the coolant and the moderator, slowing down the neutrons to facilitate the fission reaction. If, for any reason, the water stops flowing through the reactor, there will be no coolant, and ideally, the fission reaction will cease as well. Regarding the concern of neutrons hitting water, it is not a significant issue. When a hydrogen atom in water is hit by a neutron, it may create deuterium, and when an oxygen atom is hit, it simply creates O17. These byproducts do not pose a threat. Five months ago, the Russians shut down all the reactors at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant. Currently, five out of the six reactors are in cold shutdown, meaning that the chain fission reactions have completely stopped, and the nuclear material has significantly cooled down. This reduces the need for coolant to maintain core stability. The remaining reactor is in a warm shutdown state, where an external source of electricity prevents the fuel temperature from falling below 250 degrees Celsius. The reason for this warm shutdown is unclear. In conclusion, while there are concerns about a potential attack on the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, experts argue that the media has exaggerated the potential fallout. Understanding the operation of nuclear power plants and the precautions in place can help alleviate some of these concerns. I cannot explain this, but five reactors are completely shut down, while one is in a warm state. If they want to restart it, they can do so quickly. The Russians have not done that, and all fission has ceased five months ago. Therefore, the short-term radiological byproducts of the core reaction have already dissipated. These fuel rods have been sitting idle in water for five months without generating new fission reactions. To explain high-level and low-level waste from nuclear reactors, let's use an example from an Illinois Professor's YouTube video. In the core of a nuclear reactor, there are about 30 tons of uranium in the form of fuel rods. To achieve a three percent concentration of uranium-235, one ton needs to be uranium-235, while the remaining 29 tons are uranium-238. After three years of operation, the uranium-235 depletes, resulting in a decrease to 28.5 tons of uranium-238 and 0.35 tons of uranium-235. This means that 65 percent of the desired uranium has already been used. At this point, the fuel rod becomes less efficient and needs to be replaced. During the fission process, various fission products and heavier radioactive elements are generated. These include plutonium, neptunium, and uranium-236, which take thousands of years to decay. These are considered high-level waste. On the other hand, low-level waste includes items like gloves, smocks, and even the walls of the nuclear core. It also includes resin beads used to absorb non-water elements and ions in the water mixture. This resin is highly radioactive and requires proper treatment and burial. High-level waste is stored on-site at all nuclear plants in thick, stable, and safe dry cask storage containers. These containers can be approached by plant workers without any risk. These spent fuel rods contain fission products and heavier elements that took years to cool down. Although they are still radioactive and generate heat, storing them in dry casks outside is sufficient to dissipate the heat and poses no danger to anyone at the plants. The Chernobyl disaster was different because the RBMK reactor used graphite as a moderator, which caused a runaway chain reaction during the meltdown. Additionally, there was no containment shield around the reactor, allowing radioactive materials to be released into the atmosphere. This cannot happen at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant because it has a containment shield. Reports suggest that Russia is sabotaging the cooling system at the Zaporizhia plant, preventing water from reaching the core to cool it down. If the reactor vessel stops receiving water, the fuel rods will heat up indefinitely until an equilibrium is reached with the surrounding environment. However, the negative consequences would not be as severe as Chernobyl or Fukushima because all fission has ceased and the short-term radiological byproducts have already dissipated. It is unlikely that Russia's goal is to cause a nuclear disaster. If that were the case, they would be running all the cores at maximum capacity to maximize radiological damage. Instead, it seems that Russia's objective is to make the territory uninhabitable and force people to leave. By destroying the Nova Kakova Dam and the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, they are depriving the region of clean drinking water and electricity, encouraging people to relocate to other areas. The threat of radiation also plays into Russia's hands by scaring people into leaving."
