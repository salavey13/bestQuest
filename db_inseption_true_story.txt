Sure! Here's an example of how to use a connection pool for SQLite database connections in Python:

```
import sqlite3
from sqlite3 import Connection, Cursor
from sqlite3.dbapi2 import connect

from queue import Queue, Empty
from functools import wraps
from threading import Lock, Thread

# Connection pool class
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections):
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self._connections = Queue(maxsize=max_connections)
        self._lock = Lock()

    # Helper function to create new database connection
    def _create_connection(self):
        return connect("your_database.db")

    # Context manager to handle acquiring and releasing connections
    def get_connection(self) -> Connection:
        connection = self._connections.get(block=True)
        self._connections.put(connection)
        return connection

    # Decorator to automatically acquire and release connections for functions
    def with_connection(self, f):
        @wraps(f)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            connection = self.get_connection()
            try:
                return f(connection, *args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                pass  # You can add any cleanup operations here before releasing the connection
        return wrapper

    def _initialize_pool(self):
        with self._lock:
            while not self._connections.full():
                connection = self._create_connection()
                self._connections.put(connection)

    def start(self):
        thread = Thread(target=self._initialize_pool)
        thread.start()

    def close(self):
        with self._lock:
            while not self._connections.empty():
                connection = self._connections.get()
                connection.close()

# Define your functions that will use the connection pool
@connection_pool.with_connection
def get_data(connection: Connection):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
    data = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return data

@connection_pool.with_connection
def insert_data(connection: Connection, data):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table VALUES (?)", (data,))
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()

# Initialize connection pool with maximum number of connections
connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_connections=5)
connection_pool.start()

# Example usage
data = get_data()
print(data)

insert_data("New data")

# Close the connection pool when done
connection_pool.close()

```

In this example, we define a

```
ConnectionPool
```

class that handles creating and managing the SQLite connections. The

```
ConnectionPool
```

class has methods to acquire and release connections and also a decorator

```
with_connection
```

that automatically acquires a connection for the decorated functions. The pool is initialized with a maximum number of connections, and a separate thread initializes the pool by creating and adding connections to the queue.

You can use the

```
with_connection
```

decorator to wrap your database operations functions, and they will automatically acquire and release connections from the pool.

Note: Make sure to replace

```
"your_database.db"
```

with the actual path or name of your SQLite database file, and

```
"your_table"
```

with the actual table name in your database.
Assuming i have following python component in a subfolder  called "db" in my python project, please create a python main function that usees function :insert_data from main

import sqlite3 
from sqlite3 import Connection, Cursor 
from sqlite3.dbapi2 import connect 
 
from queue import Queue, Empty 
from functools import wraps 
from threading import Lock, Thread 
 
# Connection pool class 
class ConnectionPool: 
    def __init__(self, max_connections): 
        self.max_connections = max_connections 
        self._connections = Queue(maxsize=max_connections) 
        self._lock = Lock() 
 
    # Helper function to create new database connection 
    def _create_connection(self): 
        return connect("your_database.db") 
 
    # Context manager to handle acquiring and releasing connections 
    def get_connection(self) -> Connection: 
        connection = self._connections.get(block=True) 
        self._connections.put(connection) 
        return connection 
 
    # Decorator to automatically acquire and release connections for functions 
    def with_connection(self, f): 
        @wraps(f) 
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): 
            connection = self.get_connection() 
            try: 
                return f(connection, *args, **kwargs) 
            finally: 
                pass  # You can add any cleanup operations here before releasing the connection 
        return wrapper 
 
    def _initialize_pool(self): 
        with self._lock: 
            while not self._connections.full(): 
                connection = self._create_connection() 
                self._connections.put(connection) 
 
    def start(self): 
        thread = Thread(target=self._initialize_pool) 
        thread.start() 
 
    def close(self): 
        with self._lock: 
            while not self._connections.empty(): 
                connection = self._connections.get() 
                connection.close() 
 
# Define your functions that will use the connection pool 
@connection_pool.with_connection 
def get_data(connection: Connection): 
    cursor = connection.cursor() 
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table") 
    data = cursor.fetchall() 
    cursor.close() 
    return data 
 
@connection_pool.with_connection 
def insert_data(connection: Connection, data): 
    cursor = connection.cursor() 
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table VALUES (?)", (data,)) 
    connection.commit() 
    cursor.close() 
 
# Initialize connection pool with maximum number of connections 
connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_connections=5) 
connection_pool.start() 
 
# Example usage 
data = get_data() 
print(data) 
 
insert_data("New data") 
 
# Close the connection pool when done 
connection_pool.close()
Sure! Here's the main function that uses the insert_data function from your db component:

import db

def main():
    # Initialize connection pool with maximum number of connections
    connection_pool = db.ConnectionPool(max_connections=5)
    connection_pool.start()

    # Example usage
    data = db.get_data()
    print(data)

    db.insert_data("New data")

    # Close the connection pool when done
    connection_pool.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


In this code, we import the db module that contains the ConnectionPool class and the insert_data function. We then define the main function, where we initialize the connection pool, retrieve data using the get_data function, print the data, and insert new data using the insert_data function. Finally, we close the connection pool.

Note that we assume the db.py file is located in a subfolder called "db" in your Python project. Make sure to adjust the import statement if the file is located in a different location.
Exception has occurred: AttributeError 
module 'db' has no attribute 'ConnectionPool' 
  File "C:\WORK\1_July_webAndTGBot\oneSitePls\app.py", line 484, in main 
    connection_pool = db.ConnectionPool(max_connections=5)

AttributeError: module 'db' has no attribute 'ConnectionPool'
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the ConnectionPool class is not accessible from the db module. To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the ConnectionPool class is imported correctly in your db module.

Please ensure that the ConnectionPool class is defined in the db.py file and that it is imported correctly in the main script. Here's an updated version of the main script:

from db import ConnectionPool, insert_data, get_data

def main():
    # Initialize connection pool with maximum number of connections
    connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_connections=5)
    connection_pool.start()

    # Example usage
    data = get_data()
    print(data)

    insert_data("New data")

    # Close the connection pool when done
    connection_pool.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Make sure that the db.py file is in the correct location and that it contains the ConnectionPool class definition. Additionally, ensure that the insert_data and get_data functions are defined in the db.py file as well.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there is an issue with the organization of your code. Based on the error message you provided, it looks like you are trying to access the connection_pool variable from the db module, but it is not defined in that scope.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the connection_pool variable is accessible in the db module. One way to achieve this is by passing the connection_pool instance as an argument to the with_connection decorator.

Here's an updated version of your code:

import sqlite3 
from sqlite3 import Connection, Cursor 
from sqlite3.dbapi2 import connect 
 
from queue import Queue, Empty 
from functools import wraps 
from threading import Lock, Thread 
 
# Connection pool class 
class ConnectionPool: 
    def __init__(self, max_connections): 
        self.max_connections = max_connections 
        self._connections = Queue(maxsize=max_connections) 
        self._lock = Lock() 
 
    # Helper function to create new database connection 
    def _create_connection(self): 
        return connect("your_database.db") 
 
    # Context manager to handle acquiring and releasing connections 
    def get_connection(self) -> Connection: 
        connection = self._connections.get(block=True) 
        self._connections.put(connection) 
        return connection 
 
    # Decorator to automatically acquire and release connections for functions 
    def with_connection(self, f): 
        @wraps(f) 
        def wrapper(connection_pool, *args, **kwargs): # Adding the connection_pool argument here
            connection = connection_pool.get_connection() 
            try: 
                return f(connection, *args, **kwargs) 
            finally: 
                pass  # You can add any cleanup operations here before releasing the connection 
        return wrapper 
 
    def _initialize_pool(self): 
        with self._lock: 
            while not self._connections.full(): 
                connection = self._create_connection() 
                self._connections.put(connection) 
 
    def start(self): 
        thread = Thread(target=self._initialize_pool) 
        thread.start() 
 
    def close(self): 
        with self._lock: 
            while not self._connections.empty(): 
                connection = self._connections.get() 
                connection.close() 
 
# Define your functions that will use the connection pool 
@connection_pool.with_connection 
def get_data(connection: Connection): 
    cursor = connection.cursor() 
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table") 
    data = cursor.fetchall() 
    cursor.close() 
    return data 
 
@connection_pool.with_connection 
def insert_data(connection: Connection, data): 
    cursor = connection.cursor() 
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table VALUES (?)", (data,)) 
    connection.commit() 
    cursor.close() 
 
# Initialize connection pool with maximum number of connections 
connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_connections=5) 
connection_pool.start() 
 
# Example usage 
data = get_data() 
print(data) 
 
insert_data("New data") 
 
# Close the connection pool when done 
connection_pool.close()


In this updated code, I have modified the with_connection decorator to include the connection_pool argument. This allows the decorator to access the connection_pool instance when wrapping the function. Additionally, make sure that your main script imports the necessary modules correctly and that the db.py file is in the correct location.
