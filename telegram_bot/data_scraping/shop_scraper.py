# Hello! Sure, I can help you with that. To scrape an HTML page and retrieve specific information, we can use the BeautifulSoup library in Python. First, make sure you have it installed by running pip install beautifulsoup4 in your terminal or command prompt.

# Here's a Python script that will accomplish what you asked for:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

# URL of the restaurant's HTML page
url = "https://example.com/restaurant"

# Send a GET request to the URL and get the HTML content
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.text

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

# Create a CSV file to store the extracted data
with open("restaurant_menu.tsv", "w", newline="") as tsv_file:
    writer = csv.writer(tsv_file, delimiter="\t")
    writer.writerow(["Dish ID", "Image", "Description", "Price"])  # Write the header row

    # Find the elements on the page that contain dish information
    dishes = soup.find_all("div", class_="dish")

    # Loop through each dish element and extract the required information
    for dish in dishes:
        dish_id = dish.get("id")  # Assuming the dish ID is an HTML attribute
        image = dish.find("img").get("src")  # Assuming the image is inside an <img> tag
        description = dish.find("p", class_="description").text  # Assuming the description is inside a <p> tag with class "description"
        price = dish.find("span", class_="price").text  # Assuming the price is inside a <span> tag with class "price"

        # Write the extracted information to the CSV file
        writer.writerow([dish_id, image, description, price])

print("Scraping complete! The data has been saved to restaurant_menu.tsv.")


# You can replace the url variable with the actual URL of the restaurant's HTML page. After running the script, it will create a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file named "restaurant_menu.tsv" that contains the dish ID, image URL, description, and price.
